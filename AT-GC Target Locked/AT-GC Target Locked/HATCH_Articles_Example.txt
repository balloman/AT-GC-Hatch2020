(A?) plaques andintracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles. Mutations in the APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2genes increase A? production and aggregation, and thus cause early onset orfamilial AD. Even with this strong genetic evidence, recent studies support AD toresult from complex etiological alterations. Among them, aging is the strongestrisk factor for the vast majority of AD cases: Sporadic late onset AD (LOAD).Accumulation of DNA damage is a well-established aging factor. In this regard, a large amount of evidence reveals DNA damage as a critical pathological cause ofAD. Clinically, DNA damage is accumulated in brains of AD patients. Genetically, defects in DNA damage repair resulted from mutations in the BRAC1 and other DNAdamage repair genes occur in AD brain and facilitate the pathogenesis.Abnormalities in DNA damage repair can be used as diagnostic biomarkers for AD.In this review, we discuss the association, the causative potential, and thebiomarker values of DNA damage in AD pathogenesis.DOI: 10.3390/ijms21051666 PMID: 32121304 2.

Currently, intensive research is being carried out on thepathogenesis of AD. The results of these studies indicated that oxidative stress plays an important role in the onset and development of this disease. Moreover,in AD, oxidative stress is generated by both genetic and biochemical factors aswell as the functioning of the systems responsible for their formation andremoval. The genetic factors associated with the regulation of the redox systeminclude TOMM40, APOE, LPR, MAPT, APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes. The most importantbiochemical parameters related to the formation of oxidative species in AD arep53, homocysteine (Hcy) and a number of others. The formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is also related to the efficiency of the DNA repair system, theeffectiveness of the apoptosis, autophagy and mitophagy processes as well as the antioxidant potential. However, these factors are responsible for the developmentof many disorders, often with similar clinical symptoms, especially in the early stages of the disease. The discovery of markers of the early diagnosis of AD may contribute to the introduction of pharmacotherapy and slow down the progressionof this disease.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.net.DOI: 10.2174/1567205017666200224121447 PMID: 32091332 3.

More than 200 pathogenicmutations have been identified in amyloid-? precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1(PSEN1) and presenilin 2 (PSEN2). Additionally, common and rare variants occurwithin APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 that may be risk factors, protective factors, orbenign, non-pathogenic polymorphisms. Yet, to date, no single study has carefullyexamined the effect of all of the variants of unknown significance reported inAPP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 on A? isoform levels in vitro. In this study, we analyzed A?isoform levels by ELISA in a cell-based system in which each reported pathogenic and risk variant in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 was expressed individually. In order toclassify variants for which limited family history data is available, we haveimplemented an algorithm for determining pathogenicity using availableinformation from multiple domains, including genetic, bioinformatic, and in vitroanalyses. We identified 90 variants of unknown significance and classified 19 as likely pathogenic mutations. We also propose that five variants are possiblyprotective. In defining a subset of these variants as pathogenic, individualsfrom these families may eligible to enroll in observational studies and clinical trials.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

These genes affect ?-secretase-dependentgeneration of Amyloid ? (A?) peptides, the main constituent of amyloid plaquesand one of the pathological hallmarks of AD. Evaluation of patients with ADADincludes assessment of family history, clinical presentation, biomarkers,neuropathology when available and DNA sequencing data. These analyses frequently uncover novel variants of unknown significance in ADAD genes. This presents abarrier to recruitment of such individuals into clinical trials, unless abiochemical test can demonstrate that a novel mutation results in altered APPprocessing in a manner consistent with pathogenicity. Here we describe generationand characterization of a novel presenilin 1 and 2 double knock-out in N2A mouse neuroblastoma cells using CRISPR/Cas9, which results in complete ablation of A?production, decreased Pen-2 expression and Nicastrin glycosylation. Because ofthe absence of background A? secretion from endogenous ?-secretases, these cells can be used for validation of PSEN1 and PSEN2 variant effects on production of A?or other ?-secretase substrates and for biochemical studies of ?-secretasefunction using novel variants. We examined several PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutations ofknown and unknown pathogenicity. Known mutants increased A?42/A?40 ratio withvarying effect on A?40, A?42, total A? levels and Pen-2 expression, which aligns with previous work on these mutants. Our data on novel PSEN1 V142F, G206V andG206D mutations suggest that these mutations underlie the reported clinicalobservations in ADAD patients. We believe our novel cell line will be valuablefor the scientific community for reliable validation of presenilin mutations and helpful in defining their pathogenicity to improve and facilitate evaluation ofADAD patients, particularly in the context of enrollment in clinical trials.Copyright © 2020.

Even though most ADcases are sporadic, a small percentage is familial due to autosomal dominantmutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), andpresenilin-2 (PSEN2) genes. AD mutations contribute to the generation of toxicamyloid ? (A?) peptides and the formation of cerebral plaques, leading to theformulation of the amyloid cascade hypothesis for AD pathogenesis. Many drugshave been developed to inhibit this pathway but all these approaches currentlyfailed, raising the need to find additional pathogenic mechanisms. Alterations incellular calcium (Ca2+) signaling have also been reported as causative ofneurodegeneration. Interestingly, A? peptides, mutated presenilin-1 (PS1), andpresenilin-2 (PS2) variously lead to modifications in Ca2+ homeostasis. In thiscontribution, we focus on PS2, summarizing how AD-linked PS2 mutants altermultiple Ca2+ pathways and the functional consequences of this Ca2+ dysregulationin AD pathogenesis.DOI: 10.3390/ijms21030770 PMID: 31991578 Conflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.6.

One example is PS2V, the alternative transcript isoform of the PSEN2 gene. PS2V is induced byhypoxia/oxidative stress and shows increased expression in late onset, sporadicAD brains. A unique, early onset familial AD mutation of PSEN2, K115fs, mimicsthe PS2V coding sequence suggesting that forced, early expression of PS2V-likeisoforms may contribute to AD pathogenesis. Here we use zebrafish to model theK115fs mutation to investigate the effects of forced PS2V-like expression on the transcriptomes of young adult and aged adult brains.METHODS: We edited the zebrafish genome to model the K115fs mutation. To explore its effects at the molecular level, we analysed the brain transcriptome andproteome of young (6-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) wild type andheterozygous mutant female sibling zebrafish. Finally, we used gene co-expressionnetwork analysis (WGCNA) to compare molecular changes in the brains of these fishto human AD.RESULTS: Young heterozygous mutant fish show transcriptional changes suggestingaccelerated brain aging and increased glucocorticoid signalling. These earlychanges precede a transcriptional 'inversion' that leads to glucocorticoidresistance and other likely pathological changes in aged heterozygous mutantfish. Notably, microglia-associated immune responses regulated by the ETStranscription factor family are altered in both our zebrafish mutant model and inhuman AD. The molecular changes we observe in aged heterozygous mutant fish occurwithout obvious histopathology and possibly in the absence of A?.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that forced expression of a PS2V-like isoformcontributes to immune and stress responses favouring AD pathogenesis. Thishighlights the value of our zebrafish genetic model for exploring molecularmechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0227258 PMCID: PMC6980398PMID: 31978074 Conflict of interest statement: The authors have declared that no competinginterests exist.7.

However, the functional connectivity patterns within thesubsystems are unknown in presymptomatic autosomal dominant AD (ADAD).OBJECTIVE: To investigate functional connectivity patterns within the subsystems of the DMN in presymptomatic subjects carrying PSEN1, PSEN2, or APP genemutations.METHODS: Twenty-six presymptomatic mutation carriers (PMC) and twenty-ninecognitively normal non-carriers as normal controls (NC) from the same familiesunderwent resting state functional MRI and structural MRI. Seed-based analyseswere done to obtain functional connectivity of posterior and anterior DMN. Forthe regions that showed significant connectivity difference between PMC and NC,volumes were extracted and compared between the two groups. Connectivity measureswere then correlated with cognitive tests scores.RESULTS: The posterior DMN showed connectivity decrease in the PMC group ascompared with the NC group, which was primarily the connectivity of leftprecuneus with right precuneus and superior frontal gyrus; the anterior DMNshowed significant connectivity decrease in the PMC group, which was theconnectivity of medial frontal gyrus with middle frontal gyrus. In the brainregions showing connectivity changes in the PMC group, there was no groupdifference in volume. A positive correlation was observed between the precuneusconnectivity value and Mini-Mental State Examination total score.CONCLUSION: Functional connectivity within both posterior and anterior DMN weredisrupted in the presymptomatic stage of ADAD. Connectivity disruption within theposterior DMN may be useful for early identification of general cognitive declineand a potential imaging biomarker for early diagnosis.DOI: 10.3233/JAD-191065 PMID: 31929167 8.

We aimed to analyze thegenetic features of Chinese FAD pedigrees with and without PSENs/APP mutations.METHODS: In total, 1330 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment in 404 pedigrees were enrolled from the Chinese Familial Alzheimer'sDisease Network. PSENs/APP mutations and APOE frequencies were determined.RESULTS: In total, 13.12% of pedigrees carried PSENs/APP missense mutations,3.71% carried PSENs/APP synonymous/untranslated region variants, and 83.17% didnot carry PSENs/APP mutations. Eleven missense mutations were first identified.In patients without PSENs/APP mutations, 44.31% carried one APOE?4 allele, and14.85% two APOE?4 alleles.DISCUSSION: The new PSENs/APP mutations indicate heterogeneity in AD pathogenesisbetween Chinese and other ethnic groups. The low mutation rate suggests theinvolvement of other genes/factors in Chinese FAD. APOE?4 might be a major genefor some FAD without PSENs/APP mutations.© 2020 the Alzheimer's Association.DOI: 10.1002/alz.12005 PMID: 31914229 9.

In AD mouse models, relevant information can bederived from brain electrical activity. With a multi-site linear probe, werecorded local field potentials simultaneously at the posterior-parietal cortexand hippocampus of wild-type and double transgenic AD mice, under anesthesia. We focused on PS2APP (B6.152H) mice carrying both presenilin-2 (PS2) and amyloidprecursor protein (APP) mutations, at three and six months of age, before andafter plaque deposition respectively. To highlight defects linked to either thePS2 or APP mutation, we included in the analysis age-matched PS2.30H andAPP-Swedish mice, carrying each of the mutations individually. Our study alsoincluded PSEN2-/- mice. At three months, only predeposition B6.152H mice show areduction in the functional connectivity of slow oscillations (SO) and in thepower ratio between SO and delta waves. At six months, plaque-seeding B6.152Hmice undergo a worsening of the low/high frequency power imbalance and show amassive loss of cortico-hippocampal phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between SO andhigher frequencies, a feature shared with amyloid-free PS2.30H mice. We conclude that the PS2 mutation is sufficient to impair SO PAC and accelerate networkdysfunctions in amyloid-accumulating mice.DOI: 10.3390/cells9010054 PMCID: PMC7016892PMID: 31878336 Conflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.10.

Electronic address: mhaliski@uw.edu.Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) experience seizures at higher rates thanthe general population of that age, suggesting an underexplored role ofhyperexcitability in AD. Genetic variants in presenilin (PSEN) 1 and 2 genes leadto autosomal dominant early-onset AD (ADAD); patients with PSEN gene variantsalso report seizures. Pharmacological control of seizures in AD may bedisease-modifying. Preclinical efficacy of FDA-approved antiseizure drugs (ASDs) is well defined in young adult rodents; however, the efficacy of ASDs in agedrodents with chronic seizures is less clear. The mechanism by which ADAD geneslead to AD remains unclear, and even less studied is the pathogenesis of epilepsyin AD. PSEN variants generally all result in a biochemical loss of function (DeStrooper, 2007). We herein determined whether well-established models of acuteand chronic seizure could be used to explore the relationship between AD genesand seizures through investigating whether loss of normal PSEN2 functionage-dependently influenced susceptibility to seizures and/or corneal kindlingacquisition. PSEN2 knockout (KO) and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice werescreened from 2- to 10-months-old to establish age-dependent focal seizurethreshold. Additionally, PSEN2 KO and WT mice aged 2- and 8-months-old underwent corneal kindling such that mice were aged 3- and 9-months old at the beginning ofASD efficacy testing. We then defined the dose-dependent efficacy ofmechanistically distinct ASDs on kindled seizures of young versus aged mice tobetter understand the applicability of corneal kindling to real-world use forgeriatric patients. PSEN2 KO mice demonstrated early-life reductions in seizurethreshold. However, kindling acquisition was delayed in 2-month-old PSEN2 KOversus WT mice. Young male WT mice took 24.3 ± 1.3 (S.E.M.) stimulations toachieve kindling criterion, whereas age-matched PSEN2 KO male mice took41.2 ± 1.1 stimulations (p < .0001). The rate of kindling acquisition of8-month-old mice was no longer different from WT. This study demonstrates thatloss of normal PSEN2 function is associated with age-dependent changes in the in vivo susceptibility to acute seizures and kindling. Loss of normal PSEN2 functionmay be an underexplored molecular contributor to seizures. The use of validatedmodels of chronic seizures in aged rodents may uncover age-related changes insusceptibility to epileptogenesis and/or ASD efficacy in mice with AD-associated genotypes, which may benefit the management of seizures in AD.Copyright © 2019.

The escalating load ofanthropogenic organic pollutants on water bodies and its momentous impact onaquatic life may lead to the development of potent neurodegenerative diseases.Thus, the present study was conducted on zebrafish model to address the potentialrole of B[a]P in inducing neurodegenerative disease like phenotypes. WaterborneB[a]P exposure was performed for a stipulated period of 21 days at aconcentration of 0.4 ?g/ml. Separate groups of zebrafish were subjected tomethylphenidate hydrochloride (MPH: 0.15 mg/L) bath exposure to study the effect on their behaviour before B[a]P exposure. The findings of the present studyadvocate that chronic exposure to B[a]P significantly impairs the locomotoractivity in zebrafish, which showed reduction in total distance travelled andvelocity. Histopathological observation by cresyl violet staining showed thatthere was significant increase in pyknotic neuronal counts in the diencephalonand telencephalic region of zebrafish brain after B[a]P exposure. Proteinexpression study showed that there was a significant increase in ?-synuclein and decrease in UCH-L1, PSEN2, Nurr1 and NeuN expression in whole brain lysate ofB[a]P-exposed zebrafish. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), as a marker of dopaminergicneurons, was significantly reduced in the B[a]P-exposed group. MPHco-supplementation significantly ameliorated the B[a]P induced altered expressionof Parkinson's relevant proteins in zebrafish brain.

Mutations in the amyloid protein precursor (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), andpresenilin-2 (PSEN2) genes can cause autosomal dominant forms of early-onset AD(EOAD). Although these genes have been extensively studied, variantclassification remains a challenge, highlighting the need to colligate mutations across populations. In this study, we performed a genetic screening for mutationsin the APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes in 200 clinically diagnosed EOAD patientsacross four Asian countries, including Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, andKorea, between 2009 and 2018. Thirty-two (16%) patients presented pathogenic APP,PSEN1, or PSEN2 variants; eight (25%), 19 (59%), and five (16%) of the 32patients presented APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 variants, respectively. Among the 21novel and known non-synonymous variants, five APP variants were found in Koreanpatients and one APP variant was identified in a Thai patient with EOAD. Nine,two, and one PSEN1 mutation was found in a Korean patient, Malaysian siblings,and a Thai patient, respectively. Unlike PSEN1 mutations, PSEN2 mutations wererare in patients with EOAD; only three variants were found in Korean patientswith EOAD. Comparison of AD-causative point mutations in Asian countries; ourfindings explained only a small fraction of patients, leaving approximately 84%(p = 0.01) of autosomal dominant pedigrees genetically unexplained. We suggestthat the use of high-throughput sequencing technologies for EOAD patients canpotentially improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of AD.DOI: 10.3390/ijms20194757 PMCID: PMC6801447PMID: 31557888  [Indexed for MEDLINE]14.

These health benefits of green tea havebeen attributed mainly to its effective component, epigallocatechin gallate(EGCG). Because various catechin derivatives potently enhance these healthbenefits, we manipulated the extraction process with a high-temperatureintervention. High-temperature-processed green tea extract (HTP-GTE) showed anelevated proportion of gallocatechin gallate (GCG) content. To investigate thepreventive effects of HTP-GTE on cognitive decline, we found its neuroprotective effects against amyloid ? (A?)-induced neurotoxicity in neurons and clarifiedthat GCG significantly inhibited A? aggregation in vitro. Moreover, we showedthat HTP-GTE intake attenuated several cognitive-decline phenotypes in a modelmouse of Alzheimer's disease. These beneficial effects of HTP-GTE againstcognitive decline were due to the distinctive composition of the extract andsuggest the possibility that HTP-GTE supplementation could attenuate cognitivedecline of Alzheimer's disease.DOI: 10.1080/09168451.2019.1659721 PMID: 31462168  [Indexed for MEDLINE]15.

(ApoE), a protein thatassociates with lipids to form lipoproteins that package and traffic cholesterol and lipids through the bloodstream. There are at least three different alleles ofthe APOE gene: APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4. The APOE4 allele increases anindividual's risk for developing late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) in adose-dependent manner. Sex differences have been reported for AD susceptibility, age of onset, and symptom progression, with females being more affected thanmales. Methods: In this study, we use a systems biology approach to examine gene expression patterns in the brains of aged female and male individuals who arepositive for the APOE4 allele in order to identify possible sex-relateddifferences that may be relevant to AD. Results: Based on correlation analysis,we identified a large number of genes with an expression pattern similar to that of APOE in APOE4-positive individuals. The number of these genes was much higher in APOE4-positive females than in APOE4-positive males, who in turn had more ofsuch genes than APOE4-negative control groups. Our findings also indicate asignificant sex* genotype interaction for the CNTNAP2 gene, a member of theneurexin family and a significant interaction for brain area*sex* genotype forPSEN2, a risk factor gene for AD.  Conclusions: Profiling of these genes usingGene Ontology (GO) term classification, pathway enrichment, and differentialexpression analysis supports the idea of a transcriptional role of APOE withrespect to sex differences and AD.DOI: 10.12688/f1000research.18671.2 PMCID: PMC6685458PMID: 31448102 Conflict of interest statement: No competing interests were disclosed.16.

To analyze the phenotypes and genotypes of EOAD patients, we performedcomprehensive clinical assessments as well as mutation screening of PSEN1, PSEN2,and exons 16 and 17 of APP by Sanger sequencing in the three Chinese EOADfamilies. We identified two novel mutations of PSEN1 (Y256N and H214R) in samplesfrom these families, and a de novo mutation of PSEN1 (G206V) in a patient withvery early-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease. A combination of bioinformaticstools based on evolutionary, structural and computational methods predicted that the mutations were all deleterious. These findings suggest that PSEN1 Y256N,H214R, and G206V need to be considered as potential causative mutations in EOADpatients. Further functional studies are needed to evaluate the roles of thesemutations in the pathogenesis of AD.DOI: 10.14336/AD.2018.1109 PMCID: PMC6675531PMID: 31440394 Conflict of interest statement: Conflict of interest The authors declare nocompeting financial interests.17.

Here we leveragedrecent advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and CRISPR/Cas9 genomeediting technologies to generate a panel of isogenic knockin human iPSC linescarrying APP and/or PSEN1 mutations. Global transcriptomic and translatomicprofiling revealed that fAD mutations have overlapping effects on the expression of AD-related and endocytosis-associated genes. Mutant neurons also increasedRab5+ early endosome size. APP and PSEN1 mutations had discordant effects on A?production but similar effects on APP ? C-terminal fragments (?-CTFs), whichaccumulate in all mutant neurons. Importantly, endosomal dysfunction correlatedwith accumulation of ?-CTFs, not A?, and could be rescued by pharmacologicalmodulation of ?-secretase (BACE). These data display the utility of our mutantiPSCs in studying AD-related phenotypes in a non-overexpression human-basedsystem and support mounting evidence that ?-CTF may be critical in ADpathogenesis.Copyright © 2019.

Recently, emerging studies reported several novelPSEN1 mutations among Asian. We describe a male with EOAD had a pathogenic PSEN1 mutation.CASE PRESENTATION: A 53-year-old male presented with memory decline, followed by difficulty in finding ways. Patient had positive family history, since his motherand one of his brother was also affected with dementia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed mild degree of atrophy of bilateral hippocampus andparietal lobe. 18F-Florbetaben-PET (FBB-PET) revealed increased amyloiddeposition in bilateral frontal, parietal, temporal lobe and precuneus. Wholeexome analysis revealed a heterozygous, probably pathogenic PSEN1 (c.695G?>?T,p.W165C) mutation. Interestingly, Trp165Cys mutation is located in trans membrane(TM)-III region, which is conserved between PSEN1/PSEN2. In vitro studiesrevealed that PSEN1 Trp165Cys could result in disturbances in amyloid metabolism.This prediction was confirmed by structure predictions and previous in vitrostudies that the p.Trp165Cys could result in decreased A?42/A?40 ratios.CONCLUSION: We report a case of EOAD having a pathogenic PSEN1 (Trp165Cys)confirmed with in silico and in vitro predictions.DOI: 10.1186/s12883-019-1419-y PMCID: PMC6685246PMID: 31391004  [Indexed for MEDLINE]19.

However, sporadic EOAD patients havebeen insufficiently studied to define the probability of being a carrier of oneof these variants.OBJECTIVE: To describe the proportion of each genetic variation among patientswith very young-onset sporadic AD.METHODS: We first screened PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP in 154 EOAD patients with anonset before 51 years and a negative family history. Among 99 patients with nomutation (NMC), whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed. We analyzed the APOE genotype and rare protein-truncating or missense predicted damaging variants ofTREM2, SORL1, and ABCA7. Neurological examination and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)biomarkers were systematically retrieved.RESULTS: Nineteen (12.3%) mutation carriers (MC) harbored an APP or PSEN1pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant. Among the NMC, 54/99 carried at leastone genetic risk factor, including 9 APOE4/E4 homozygous, 37 APOE4 heterozygous, and 14 with a rare variant in another risk factor gene: 3 SORL1, 4 TREM2, and 9ABCA7. MC presented an earlier disease onset (p?<?0.0001) and associatedneurologic symptoms more frequently (p?<?0.002). All but one patient had at least2 CSF biomarkers in abnormal ranges.CONCLUSION: The genetic component of very early sporadic EOAD gathers asubstantial proportion of pathogenic variants in autosomal dominant genes and an even higher proportion of patients carrying genetic risk factors, suggesting anoligogenic determinism, even at this range of ages.DOI: 10.3233/JAD-190193 PMID: 31381512 20.

Electronic address: jjp@ccmu.edu.cn.Presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2), and amyloid precursor protein (APP)genes account for the majority of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (AD),with PSEN1 being the most common. We screened these genes for mutations in aChinese proband from an autosomal dominant early-onset AD pedigree. Early-onsetAD is defined as the age at onset of AD < 65 years. A heterozygous variant(c.332G > T) of PSEN1, which results in a missense mutation (p.Gly111Val), wasidentified. Three prediction programs suggested this mutation was diseasecausing. When PSEN1 Gly111Val was overexpressed in HEK293/APPswe cells, the ratioof A?42/A?40 was significantly increased compared with that of wild-type PSEN1.Our results suggest that this novel PSEN1 Gly111Val mutation may play apathogenic role in AD.Copyright © 2019.
